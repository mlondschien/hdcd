## README

This folder contains R scripts to replicate figure 2 (`curve_smoothing.R`) and figure 3 (`compare_imputation.R`) of the paper [Change point detection for graphical models in the presence of missing values](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.05409.pdf). The file `groundwater.R` contains code to produce figure 6, but cannot be run as it requires external data which we are not allowed to publish. To produce figure 4, see the `simulations/histogram` folder.
